# Sentimental Analysis on twitter data

The process of determining whether a block of text is positive, negative, or neutral is known as sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is the contextual mining of words that indicates the social sentiment of a brand and also assists businesses in determining whether or not the product that they are manufacturing will be in demand in the market. Sentiment analysis attempts to achieve the goal of analysing people's opinions in order to assist businesses in expanding. It is concerned not only with polarity (positive, negative, and neutral), but also with emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.). It employs a variety of Natural Language Processing algorithms, including rule-based, automatic, and hybrid.

For example, if we want to determine whether a product meets customer needs or whether there is a market need for this product. We can use sentiment analysis to keep track of the reviews for that product. Sentiment analysis is also useful when there is a large set of unstructured data that needs to be classified by automatically tagging.
